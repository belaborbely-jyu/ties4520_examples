    <!--
    	Here starts the protocol graph.

        In this template, the sequence of predicates (properties: sswap:operatesOn,
        sswap:hasMapping, and sswap:mapsTo) join nodes of types sswap:Resource,
        sswap:Graph, sswap:Subject, and sswap:Object respectively.  It is the
        conceptual analogy of the fundamental RDF model of subject -> predicate
        -> object, but here abstracted to express that "some resource" has
        "some mapping" of a subject to an object.

        To establish an actual mapping, add predicates and restrictions to
        the sswap:Subject and sswap:Object nodes. These nodes anchor arbitrary
        OWL subgraphs with domain-specific ontologies. The sswap:Graph node is
        for certain complex mappings only.
